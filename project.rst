Project work
============

.. note:: EXPERIMENTAL!!! Information on this page will still change drastically.

Choose a project work. There are two projects to choose from:

1. biological sequence analysis (part07)
2. regression analysis on medical data (part08)
   
After you have completed 65% of points from week 6, download the exercises
and/or notebooks from the TMC server.
Then try to solve as many exercises as you can.
Then submit your solutions to the TMC server.
Note that the TMC server is only used here for helping you
to proceed with the project work. Your final project work
returned to Moodle can include partial solutions.

The two projects differ a lot in their workflow. See the below sections
on individual projects to see in detail how solving, testing and reporting
of exercises are done in each project.

Save the report as a Jupyter notebook file (with ``ipynb`` extension)
and submit this file to Moodle.
After this you will need to give feedback for your own
report and two other reports. The feedback is given in two categories:

1. correctness of solutions
2. clarity of writing (of the idea of solution and discussion) and code
   
In each category, in addition to textual feedback, give also
a grade in the range 0, 1, ..., 5.
The final grade for the project work will be the weighted average
over the two categories, where category 1 has weight 2, and
the second has weight 1. More details can be found in the Moodle.
You must get at least grade 1 for the project work.

You have ten days to finish the project solutions and report
(26.4. - 6.5.). After that you have 7 days to do the peer review.
Deadline for peer review is on 13.5.

Sequence analysis
-----------------

Complete the exercises of the project like normal weekly exercises.

Copy the file ``project_notebook_sequence_analysis.ipynb`` to folder
``hy-data-analysis-with-python-spring-2019``,
where your solutions are. Start Jupyter with ``jupyter-notebook project_notebook.ipynb``.
Fill in the missing boxes. Run all cells; it should find the source code
of your solutions, and include them in the notebook. Do not modify lines that say ``# exercise x``.
Avoid too long lines as they might not be visible without horizontal scrolling.

Next to each exercise in the report there are also two text boxes for you
to fill. In the first box, in your own words, describe the idea of the
solution to the exercise. In the second box analyse the results,
including how the program worked with the given example input or
your own examples. 

NOTE. Exercises in section "Stationary and equilibrium distributions (extra)"
(exercises 20, 21, and 22) are not obligatory. Thus, you only need to do
19 exercises, if you are aiming to get full points.

Regression analysis
-------------------

Write solutions to exercises directly into the cells of the given Jupyter notebook.
Do not modify lines that say ``# exercise x``; without those the tests won't work.
Don't use additional cells, and do in each cell exactly as the instructions say.
Save the file and run ``tmc test``. The tests read and execute directly the cells
of the notebook.
Make sure the notebook looks readable, and submit the resulting notebook to Moodle.
